  <h1 class="headline">1. Old Oak Tap BLT</h1>
  <p>The B is applewood smoked&#8212;nice and snappy. The L is arugula&#8212;fresh and peppery. The T is a fried green slice&#8212;jacketed in cornmeal and greaseless. Slathered with pimiento cheese, the grilled ciabatta somehow stays crisp, providing three distinct layers of crunch. Truly inspired.</p>
